# Agent Instructions

## Protected Files — DO NOT MODIFY

The following files must **never** be modified unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so:

- `cc-hdrm/cc-hdrm/cc_hdrm.entitlements` — Xcode entitlements plist. Modifying or emptying this file breaks Keychain access and network permissions at runtime. If a task does not specifically require entitlement changes, leave this file untouched.
