# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 20-3-tpp-data-model-passive-measurement-engine (2026-03-27)

- `Int32` truncation for token counts in `TPPStorageService` — `sqlite3_bind_int(Int32(...))` used for `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_create_tokens`, `cache_read_tokens`, `total_raw_tokens`, `message_count` columns. SQLite INTEGER is 64-bit but bind is 32-bit, risking silent data corruption for very large token counts. Pre-existing pattern from `storeBenchmarkResult` in Story 20.1 — fix should apply to all `sqlite3_bind_int` token columns in `TPPStorageService` at the same time.

## Deferred from: code review of 20-5-historical-tpp-backfill (2026-03-27)

- AC-1 progress indicator for app-launch backfill path not implemented — the spec says "a subtle progress indicator appears if the backfill takes >5 seconds" on first launch. The SettingsView button state ("Running...") only covers the manual re-run path, not the automatic fire-and-forget launch-path. Requires UI plumbing in AppDelegate/PopoverView to surface a progress state. Deferred to Story 20.4 or a dedicated polish story.
